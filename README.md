#Swipy

An experiment with gestures

## Running the application
This application can be run with some web browsers
simply by launching index.html.  However, some web browsers
will not allow JavaScript to run from the file:// schema. As a
result, you may want to use a http server. One option is to use
the newest release of Python, open a command prompt, change to
this app's directory and enter:

		python -m http.server

Then browse to `http://localhost:8000`. Or use the port you may have
provided.
